# Tools

Looking to work more comfortably, we recommend the use of the following tools:

## 1. NODE VERSION MANAGEMENT

Using nvm (Node Version Manager) makes it easier to install and manage multiple versions of Node.js on a single local environment. Even if you only need a single version of Node.js right now, we still recommend using nvm because it allows you to switch between different versions of Node (depending on the requirements of your project) with minimal hassle.

## 2. VISUAL CODE EXTENSIONS

### Mandatory

- ESLINT integrates ESLint into VS Code. The extension uses the ESLint library installed in the opened workspace folder. If the folder doesn't provide one the extension looks for a global install version.
